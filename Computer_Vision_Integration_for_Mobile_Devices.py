# /*
# The process of using a phone camera with Python:

# First, install the OpenCV library in Python; pip install opencv-python.

# Download and install the IP Webcam application on your smartphones.

# After installing the IP Webcam app, make sure your phone and PC are connected to the same network. 

# Run the app on your phone and click Start Server.

# After that, your camera will open with an IP address at the bottom. 

# Copy the IP address as we will need to use it in our Python code to open your phoneâ€™s camera.*/
